# Linear-Regression-SVM-Naive-Bayes-Models
This project aims to develop predictive models for heart disease using logistic regression, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes classifiers. The models are trained on clinical and physiological data to assess the likelihood of heart disease, demonstrating the application of various machine learning techniques with Python and Scikit-Learn.
